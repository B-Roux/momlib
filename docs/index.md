This package attempts to capture a limited set of advanced mathematical
    objects and their associated operations in the most basic and
    natural data types and structures available in standard Python 3,
    and while having no requirements other than the Python standard
    library.

At the moment, this package is being developed by me for my own
    purposes, but I hope that enough people find it useful enough that
    that stops being the case. Thank you for using and supporting my
    project!

Please note that this package is currently in version 0.0.x meaning
    very early development. The public API may change drastically and
    often. As soon as version 0.1.0 is released, you should in most
    cases be able to expect some consistency. I hope this comes soon!
    
# Installing

## Quick Notes

- I am currently in the process of completely re-doing the documentation, thank you for understanding that this may take some time and that finding information may not be very convenient until this is done.
