# Graph Theory

The linear algebra submodule currently contains two object definitions and an
    assortment of methods for working with them. Please find the relevant
    references below:

## Graphs (undirected)

[Graph Instance Methods](./graph)

Expresses the mathematical notion of an undirected, optionally
    weighted graph in native Python datastructures and datatypes
    while providing an assortment of tools to perform basic graph
    manipulations.

## DiGraphs

[DiGraph Instance Methods](./digraph)

Expresses the mathematical notion of a directed, optionally
    weighted graph in native Python datastructures and datatypes
    while providing an assortment of tools to perform basic graph
    manipulations.

## Graph Theory Tools

[Graph Theory Tools](./tools)

Provides an assortment of more advanced tools to work with `Graph` and
    `DiGraph` objects.
